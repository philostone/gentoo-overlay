# philostone/gentoo-overlay
My personal gentoo overlay (this) and app (gentoo-app) repositories

This is where I keep personal ebuilds for (some) experimental projects (at philostone/gentoo-apps), personal patches, etc.

If you become inspired and use some of the code, you are welcome!
If you have suggestions/additions/bugs/etc., feel free to suggest them, but be aware that this is a very sporadically maintained repository, primarliy indended for personal use. I might not look at your work for a long time. Hence, if your own system experience depends on your patch, I urge you to create a personal (perhaps public - then renamed) fork. If you do so, I would appreciate if you send a message telling me about it, as it would be nice to be able to keep track of which way it develops and where!

Happy coding!
